I made this website today to create a space for myself to document every little to big software endeavor that I take on. I worked at Robert Bosch LLC since Summer of 2017, up until September of 2020 and never bothered to create a website for myself. I'm hoping to find that extra boost of motivation at home during a pandemic and a meniscus tear to build some fun projects to not only grow my portfolio but to also look back on this and remind myself why I created this website.
